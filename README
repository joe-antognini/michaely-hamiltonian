A numerical test to of the Hamiltonian given by Eq. 2 of Michaely &
Perets (2014).  The program here takes a single star and scatters it off of
a binary star system.  It can be run with the following command:

make binsingle
binsingle > results.dat 2> results.out

results.out contains a summary of the results of the scattering experiment.
results.dat contains the Hamiltonian of the system as a function of time.
